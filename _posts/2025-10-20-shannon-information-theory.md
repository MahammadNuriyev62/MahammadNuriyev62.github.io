> **One‑sentence take‑away:** _Claude Shannon's 1948 paper didn't just invent information theory—it revealed that information is measurable, compressible, and transmittable with perfect reliability, transforming communication, computing, and our understanding of knowledge itself._

---

## 1 The revolution hidden in plain sight

In 1948, a 32-year-old Bell Labs engineer published a paper titled _"A Mathematical Theory of Communication"_.

Within a decade, it reshaped:

- **Telecommunications** — How we design modems, cellular networks, and satellites
- **Data compression** — ZIP, JPEG, MP3, modern video codecs
- **Cryptography** — One-time pads, stream ciphers, perfect secrecy
- **Machine learning** — Cross-entropy loss, KL divergence, information bottleneck
- **Neuroscience** — How brains encode sensory information
- **Physics** — Black hole entropy, thermodynamics of computation

Shannon gave us a **universal language for uncertainty**, and we're still discovering its implications.

## 2 The core question: What is information?

Before Shannon, "information" was vague—news, data, knowledge, meaning.

Shannon made it precise:

> **Information is the reduction of uncertainty.**

If I tell you something you already knew → 0 information.
If I tell you something completely surprising → maximum information.

**Example:**

- "The sun rose this morning" → 0 bits (you knew that)
- "A coin flip landed heads" → 1 bit (50/50 uncertainty resolved)
- "Tomorrow's winning lottery number is 3,817,294" → ~23 bits (1 in 10 million resolved)

Information measures **surprise**, not meaning.

---

## 3 Entropy: The heartbeat of uncertainty

Shannon borrowed the term **entropy** from thermodynamics. For a random variable $X$ with possible outcomes $x_i$ having probabilities $p(x_i)$:

$$
H(X) = -\sum_{i} p(x_i) \log_2 p(x_i) \quad \text{(bits)}
$$

### Why this formula?

Shannon wanted a measure that satisfies:

1. **Monotonicity** — More outcomes → more entropy
2. **Additivity** — Independent events add entropies
3. **Continuity** — Small probability changes yield small entropy changes

Turns out, the logarithmic form is the **only** function satisfying these axioms.

---

## 4 Entropy in action: Concrete examples

### 4.1 Fair coin flip

$X \in \\{\text{H}, \text{T}\\}$, each with $p = 0.5$

$$
H(X) = -0.5 \log_2(0.5) - 0.5 \log_2(0.5) = 1 \text{ bit}
$$

Maximum uncertainty—one bit to encode the outcome.

### 4.2 Biased coin

$X \in \\{\text{H}, \text{T}\\}$, but $p(\text{H}) = 0.9, p(\text{T}) = 0.1$

$$
H(X) = -0.9 \log_2(0.9) - 0.1 \log_2(0.1) \approx 0.47 \text{ bits}
$$

Less surprise—knowing the bias reduces entropy.

### 4.3 English text

If letters appeared uniformly at random, English would have:

$$
H \approx \log_2(26) \approx 4.7 \text{ bits/letter}
$$

But English has structure (common letters like 'E', bigram patterns like 'TH'):

$$
H_{\text{English}} \approx 1.0\text{–}1.5 \text{ bits/letter (Shannon's estimate)}
$$

**Implication:** We can compress English text by a factor of ~3–4× without loss.

## 5 The Source Coding Theorem: Optimal compression

Shannon's **noiseless coding theorem** (1948) says:

> _You cannot compress data below its entropy on average, but you can get arbitrarily close._

Formally:
- Let $H(X)$ be the entropy of source $X$
- Any lossless compression requires $\geq H(X)$ bits per symbol on average
- There exists a code achieving $H(X) + \epsilon$ for any $\epsilon > 0$

### Huffman coding example

Suppose we have a source with probabilities:

| Symbol | Probability | Huffman code |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| A      | 0.5         | 0            |
| B      | 0.25        | 10           |
| C      | 0.125       | 110          |
| D      | 0.125       | 111          |

**Entropy:**

$$
H = -0.5 \log_2(0.5) - 0.25 \log_2(0.25) - 2 \times 0.125 \log_2(0.125) = 1.75 \text{ bits}
$$

**Average Huffman code length:**

$$
L = 0.5(1) + 0.25(2) + 0.125(3) + 0.125(3) = 1.75 \text{ bits}
$$

Perfect match! Huffman achieves the entropy bound.

## 6 The Channel Coding Theorem: Reliable communication over noise

Shannon's second bombshell:

> _Every communication channel has a capacity $C$ (bits/second). You can transmit at any rate $R < C$ with arbitrarily low error, but not above $C$._

### The noisy channel setup

- **Input:** Message bits
- **Channel:** Adds noise (e.g., flipped bits)
- **Output:** Corrupted bits
- **Goal:** Recover the message

**Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC):**

- Flip each bit with probability $p$
- Capacity: $C = 1 - H(p) = 1 + p \log_2(p) + (1-p) \log_2(1-p)$

If $p = 0.1$ (10% error rate):

$$
C \approx 1 - 0.47 = 0.53 \text{ bits per transmission}
$$

You can still transmit reliably at ~53% speed by using **error-correcting codes**.

---

## 7 Error-correcting codes: How reliability emerges from redundancy

### 7.1 Repetition code (naive)

Send each bit 3 times: `0 → 000`, `1 → 111`
Decode by majority vote: `010 → 0` (2 out of 3 zeros)

**Rate:** 1/3 (inefficient)
**Error correction:** Handles 1 bit flip per block

### 7.2 Hamming (7,4) code (smarter)

Encodes 4 data bits into 7 bits with 3 parity checks.
Can detect 2-bit errors and correct 1-bit errors.

**Rate:** 4/7 ≈ 57% (better!)

### 7.3 Modern codes (turbo, LDPC, polar)

Used in 4G/5G, satellite communication, deep-space probes.
Achieve rates within 0.0045 dB of Shannon's theoretical limit.

**Example:** Voyager 1, 15 billion miles away, sends data at 160 bits/second with virtually no errors—Shannon's theorem in action.

---

## 8 Mutual information: Measuring what two variables share

**Mutual Information** $I(X; Y)$ quantifies how much knowing $X$ reduces uncertainty about $Y$:

$$
I(X; Y) = H(Y) - H(Y \mid X)
$$

- $I(X; Y) = 0$ → $X$ and $Y$ are independent (knowing one tells you nothing)
- $I(X; Y) = H(Y)$ → $X$ completely determines $Y$ (perfect correlation)

### Application: Feature selection in ML

If feature $X$ has low $I(X; Y)$ with target $Y$, drop it—it's uninformative.
Tools like **mRMR (minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance)** use mutual information to pick the best features.

---

## 9 Cross-entropy and KL divergence: The ML connection

### 9.1 Kullback-Leibler divergence

Measures "distance" between two probability distributions $P$ and $Q$:

$$
D_{KL}(P \parallel Q) = \sum_i P(i) \log_2 \frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}
$$

**Interpretation:** Extra bits needed if you use code optimized for $Q$ but data comes from $P$.

**Properties:**

- $D_{KL}(P \parallel Q) \geq 0$
- $D_{KL}(P \parallel Q) = 0 \iff P = Q$
- **Not symmetric:** $D_{KL}(P \parallel Q) \neq D_{KL}(Q \parallel P)$

### 9.2 Cross-entropy loss

In classification:

$$
H(P, Q) = -\sum_i P(i) \log Q(i)
$$

Where:
- $P$ = true labels (one-hot encoded)
- $Q$ = model's predicted probabilities

Minimizing cross-entropy = minimizing $D_{KL}(P \parallel Q)$ = making predictions match reality.

**Every neural network you've trained uses this.**

## 10 Shannon entropy vs Thermodynamic entropy

| Shannon Entropy                                | Thermodynamic Entropy                       |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Measures information uncertainty               | Measures physical disorder                  |
| $H = -\sum p_i \log p_i$                       | $S = k_B \ln \Omega$ (Boltzmann)            |
| Units: bits (or nats)                          | Units: J/K (joules per kelvin)              |
| Applies to abstract probability distributions  | Applies to physical systems (gas, heat)     |

**Deep connection (Landauer's Principle):**

> _Erasing 1 bit of information dissipates at least $k_B T \ln 2$ joules of heat._

**Implication:** Computation has a thermodynamic cost. Irreversible operations generate heat—this is why CPUs need cooling.

## 12 Information theory in biology

### 12.1 DNA as a code

Human genome: ~3 billion base pairs, 4 symbols (A, T, G, C)

Naive entropy: $\log_2(4) = 2$ bits/base → 6 billion bits total

But DNA has structure (repeats, genes, regulatory regions):
Effective entropy ≈ 1.5–1.8 bits/base

**Compression potential:** Yes! Genome compression algorithms exploit this.

### 12.2 Neural coding

Neurons communicate via spike trains. Shannon's framework helps answer:

- How many bits/second does a neuron transmit?
- How efficiently does the retina encode visual information?

Estimates: ~1–3 bits/spike in sensory neurons.

### 12.3 Evolution as an information process

Natural selection = iterative compression of environmental information into genomes.
Successful organisms = those whose genomes efficiently encode survival strategies.

---

## 13 The limits: What information theory cannot do

### 13.1 It ignores meaning

Shannon entropy treats all messages equally:

- "The cat sat on the mat" (English)
- "Xqr fng png ba gur zng" (ROT13 nonsense)

Both have similar entropy, but one is meaningful.
**Semantic information** requires different frameworks (still an open problem).

### 13.2 It assumes known probabilities

$H(X) = -\sum p(x) \log p(x)$ requires knowing $p(x)$.
In practice, we estimate from data—introduces uncertainty about uncertainty.

### 13.3 Single-shot scenarios

Shannon's theorems hold **asymptotically** (long sequences).
For one-time events, entropy is less predictive.
Enter **algorithmic information theory** (Kolmogorov complexity).

---

## 14 The philosophical bombshell: Information is physical

**Wheeler's "It from Bit" hypothesis:**

> _Every physical quantity derives its ultimate significance from bits, binary yes-or-no indications._

**Black hole entropy:**

$$
S = \frac{k_B A}{4 \ell_P^2}
$$

Where $A$ = horizon area, $\ell_P$ = Planck length.

Black holes have **maximum entropy** for their volume—they're the ultimate information sinks.

**Holographic principle:** All information in a 3D volume can be encoded on its 2D boundary.

Information theory isn't just about communication—it's woven into the fabric of reality.

## 15 Python playground: Compute your own entropy

```python
import math
from collections import Counter

def entropy(data):
    """Compute Shannon entropy of a sequence"""
    counts = Counter(data)
    total = len(data)
    probs = [count / total for count in counts.values()]
    return -sum(p * math.log2(p) for p in probs if p > 0)

# Test cases
print(f"Fair coin: {entropy(['H', 'T'] * 100):.2f} bits")  # ≈1.00
print(f"Biased coin: {entropy(['H'] * 90 + ['T'] * 10):.2f} bits")  # ≈0.47
print(f"English sample: {entropy('the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'):.2f} bits")  # ~4.15

# Compression ratio
import zlib
text = "a" * 1000
compressed = zlib.compress(text.encode())
print(f"Compression ratio: {len(compressed) / len(text):.2%}")  # ~0.1% (highly redundant)
```

## 17 The legacy

Shannon's theory is the **20th century's quiet revolution**.

No flashy applications at first—just abstract math about probability and logarithms.

But look around:

- Every byte transmitted over the internet
- Every phone call
- Every compressed photo
- Every error-free space probe transmission
- Every neural network training run

All built on Shannon's 1948 foundation.

**He didn't just solve communication problems—he revealed that information is as fundamental as energy.**

The universe computes. Entropy always increases. And we—conscious information-processing systems—are just beginning to understand the code.
